# Configuration files for StoRM Tape and WebDAV

This repo holds the configuration files for the tape-dev.cr.cnaf.infn.it machine which we use for 
testing [StoRM Tape](https://baltig.infn.it/cnafsd/storm-tape) and possibly [StoRM WebDAV](https://github.com/italiangrid/storm-webdav).

Basically, only the machine certificate is outside this repo.

Before installation, some manual step needs to be done (in particular, set proper permission for user 1000 to SA `dteam` and `test.vo`).
